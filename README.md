## CIT 281 Lab 03

In this lab we: 
- Practice refactoring JavaScript code to use more modern syntax
- Practice destructuring an object
- Practice converting normal functions into arrow function expressions
- Examine using for..in  syntax with objects
- Practice using for..of syntax with arrays
- Practice creating a Node.js compatible code module using module.exports
- Practice importing a Node.js compatible code module using require
- Examine code using the spread operator

In this lab I learned how to refactor and destructure code. I also learned about the for..in and for..of methods. I also refined my skills with the arrow functions we learned earlier in the minor.
